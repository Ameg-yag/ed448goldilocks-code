    First revision.
    
    Private keys are now longer.  They now store a copy of the public key, and
    a secret symmetric key for signing purposes.
    
    Signatures are now supported, though like everything else in this library,
    their format is not stable.  They use a deterministic Schnorr mode,
    similar to EdDSA.  Precomputed low-latency signing is not supported (yet?).
    The hash function is SHA-512.
    
    The deterministic hashing mode needs to be changed to HMAC (TODO!).  It's
    currently envelope-MAC.
    
    Probably in the future there will be a distinction between ECDH key and
    signing keys (and possibly also MQV keys etc).
    
    Began renaming internal functions.  Removing p448_ prefixes from EC point
    operations.  Trying to put the verb first.  For example,
    "p448_isogeny_un_to_tw" is now called "twist_and_double".
    
    Began documenting with Doxygen.  Use "make doc" to make a very incomplete
    documentation directory.
    
    There have been many other internal changes.

    Initial import and benchmarking scripts.
    
    Keygen and ECDH are implemented, but there's no hash function.
